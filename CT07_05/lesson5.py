## Task 1: List of 100 numbers 
# You are preparing for an upcoming lucky draw session at your
# school. You have been tasked to create a program that will pick
# 100 lucky winners.

# By importing the 'random' library and using 'random.randint()',
# create a program to create 100 random numbers in a list
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000
# Modify your program from the previous task to create 100 random
# unique numbers in a list.
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000
# 3. Ensure that all the numbers are unique
# 4. Print the list of 100 unique numbers created

# Hint: Use a while loop to check if the number already exists in
# the loop
## Task 3: Score Taker
# Imagine the list that you have created in Task 2 represent the
# score of a 100 students.

# Find the maximum, minimum and average from the list.

# 1. Using the 'max()' function, find the maximum score.
# 2. Using the 'min()' function, find the minimum score.
# 3. Using the 'sum()' and 'len()' function, calculate the
#    average score.
# winners = [ ]

# for count in range(100):
#     anumber = random.randint(1,1000)
#     if anumber in winners:
#         anumber = random.randint(1,1000)
#     winners.append(anumber)

# print(winners)
# print(max(winners))
# print(min(winners))
# print(round(sum(winners)/len(winners)))
## Task 4: Who is the tallest?
# Task: You are given 2 lists, 
# **namelist** contains a list of students in your class
# **heightlist** contains a list of the corresponding student's
#                height

# 1. Determine who is the tallest in class, and what is his/ her
#    name
# 2. Determine who is the shortest in class, and what is his/ her
#    name

# Sample Data (Copy + paste the below code):
# namelist = ["Olivia", "Liam", "Emma", "Noah", "Ava", "Ethan",
#             "Sophia", "Lucas", "Mia", "Aiden"
#             ]
# heightlist = [160, 165, 158, 170, 162, 168, 159, 172, 164, 166] 
# tallest = max(heightlist)
# whichindex = heightlist.index(tallest)
# print(whichindex)
# print("The tallest person in the class is: " + namelist[whichindex])
# Hint:
# use .index("value of something in the list") to find the index
# of an item
